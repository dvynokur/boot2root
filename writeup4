Here we will describe another way to get root

Follow the steps from writeup3 until you are able to login via ssh as `laurie`

After you receive the login and the password you need to write in the terminal:
> ssh laurie@10.111.1.24 
You'll be asked for a password:
    `330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4`

So we got into the `laurie` account and can get the information about the system to understand if we can exploit it at "https://www.exploit-db.com/". So:
> uname -r
> cat /etc/*-release
or 

> uname -mrs

The response for the last command is:

Linux 3.2.0-91-generic-pae i686

We search for a "Race Condition Privilege Escalation" security vulnerability at "https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40839" and find it out. 

So we create a new file :
> vi expl.c

Copy script from the website above to this document and save it using `:wq`.

After that you need to compile it and run:
> gcc -pthread expl.c -o expl -lcrypt && ./expl 

It will ask for a new password so set it and don't forget.

The script we used changed the name of the root to firefart so to get to to root you need to use a command:
> su firefart
    Enter with password you've set.

You can check the rights with the command `whoami`
