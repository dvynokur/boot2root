Launch given .iso file with .

Scan for its IP adress using ifconfig command in terminal.

Desired IP adress starts with "192.168".
In our case, it is 192.168.140.1.

Then we need to find the open ports on this system. To perform it we can use Nmap tool. If it is not installed on the machine, type:

"brew install nmap"

Scan a range of IPs starting with an IP address found step before. Type in terminal:

"nmap 192.168.140.1-255"

We receive available ports on the system. Our output:

> nmap 192.168.140.1-255
> Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-04-25 14:05 EEST

We have an open http port (80) for 192.168.140.134. So we can look for existing Web Objects. To do it we use DIRB package (github.com/v0re/dirb.git). To install it (if not yet installed) just clone the repo and "make" the programm:

1) "git clone https://github.com/v0re/dirb.git"
2) "dirb"
3) "./configure"
4) "make"

To find the entries launch the following:

"./dirb https://192.168.140.134/ wordlists/common.txt"

It gives us many web directories, main of them are: 
	
	- https://192.168.140.134/phpmyadmin/
	- https://192.168.140.134/webmail/
	- https://192.168.140.134/forum/

Let's explore them. https://192.168.140.134/phpmyadmin/ requires login and password. The same thing for https://192.168.140.134/webmail/. Let's try to find some information on the forum (https://192.168.140.134/forum/). There are four topics on the forum. We observe the topic "Probleme login ?". We can find Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

> Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2

A little bit later, on Oct 5 08:46:01, the session was opened for user lmezard:

> Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)

We can assume that invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ actually is a password for lmezard user. Try to login. It is 
successful. After login we can look for some information in the lmezard profile. We have here just an E-mail address: laurie@borntosec.net

Now with this E-mail address we can try to get the mail of lmezard accessing to the page https://192.168.140.134/webmail/ we found earlier with DIRB.

Successful. Here we have two mails. One of them is called "DB Access". Inside we have:

> Hey Laurie,
> You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
> Best regards.

We can try to use this login and password to acces the third directory found using DIRB - https://192.168.140.134/phpmyadmin/. Use login root and password Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
Login successful. 

PHP-MyAdmin is a GUI based interface for MySQL database. Next step we will to try to attack this database to access shell.
We will use command shell_exec — Execute command via shell and return the complete output as a string.















"brew install inetutils"
