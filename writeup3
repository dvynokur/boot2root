Launch given .iso file with Virtual Box

Scan for its IP adress.

In our case, it is 10.111.1.24

Then we need to find the open ports on this system. To perform it we can use Nmap tool. If it is not installed on the machine, type:

"brew install nmap"

Scan a range of IPs starting with an IP address found step before. Type in terminal:

"nmap 10.111.1.24"

We receive available ports on the system. Our output:

> nmap 10.111.1.24
> Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-04-26 19:58 EEST
> Nmap scan report for 10.111.1.24
> Host is up (0.11s latency).
> Not shown: 994 closed ports
> PORT    STATE SERVICE
> 21/tcp  open  ftp
> 22/tcp  open  ssh
> 80/tcp  open  http
> 143/tcp open  imap
> 443/tcp open  https
> 993/tcp open  imaps


We have an open http port (80) for 10.111.1.24. So we can look for existing Web Objects. To do it we use DIRB package (github.com/v0re/dirb.git). To install it (if not yet installed) just clone the repo and "make" the programm:

1) "git clone https://github.com/v0re/dirb.git"
2) "dirb"
3) "./configure"
4) "make"

To find the entries launch the following:

"./dirb https://10.111.1.24/ wordlists/common.txt"

It gives us many web directories, main of them are: 
	
	- https://10.111.1.24/phpmyadmin/
	- https://10.111.1.24/webmail/
	- https://10.111.1.24/forum/

Let's explore them. https://10.111.1.24.134/phpmyadmin/ requires login and password. The same thing for https://10.111.1.24/webmail/. Let's try to find some information on the forum (https://192.168.140.134/forum/). There are four topics on the forum. We observe the topic "Probleme login ?". We can find Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ

> Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2

A little bit later, on Oct 5 08:46:01, the session was opened for user lmezard:

> Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)

We can assume that invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ actually is a password for lmezard user. Try to login. It is 
successful. After login we can look for some information in the lmezard profile. We have here just an E-mail address: laurie@borntosec.net

Now with this E-mail address we can try to get the mail of lmezard accessing to the page https://10.111.1.24/webmail/ we found earlier with DIRB.

Successful. Here we have two mails. One of them is called "DB Access". Inside we have:

> Hey Laurie,
> You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
> Best regards.

We can try to use this login and password to acces the third directory found using DIRB - https://192.168.140.134/phpmyadmin/. Use login root and password Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$
Login successful. 

PHP-MyAdmin is a GUI based interface for MySQL database. Next step we will to try to attack this database to access shell.
We will use command shell_exec â€” Execute command via shell and return the complete output as a string.















"brew install inetutils"
