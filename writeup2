The second way is manualy launch Linux kernel and initrd. 

Linux kernel executable is "vmlinuz" file. It is capable of loading the operating system into memory so that the computer becomes usable and application programs can be run. 
vmlinuz (= Virtual Memory LINUx gZip) is compressed  Linux kernel Executable.
It could be found in /casper/vmlinus. Casper - a hook for initramfs-tools to boot live systems. To load the Linux kernel it is needed to specify the parameter "boot=casper".
Initrd (= initial RAMdisk) is a scheme for loading a temporary root file system into memory, which may be used as part of the Linux startup process. It is stored in "/casper/initrd.gz".

So we need to write a proper instructions for the kernel to load the needed file.

To perform this we need to get boot menu by holding "shift" key during the launching of a given .iso file in the Virtual Box. 
Then type:

`/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.gz -- init=/bin/sh`

or 

`/casper/vmlinuz boot=casper initrd=/casper/initrd.gz -- init=/bin/bash`

Check root privileges by typing "whoami".
