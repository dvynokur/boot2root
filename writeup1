Method 1. Using GRUB (boot menu) to invoke bash

Boot up the .iso file using VMBox, and after the VMBox launch screen, hold down the left Shift key to get to boot menu.

Type "live init=/bin/bash" or "live init=/bin/sh". This command tells the Linux kernel to run /bin/bash as init, rather than the system init.

Check root privileges by typing "whoami".

The answer is: 
> root


## After getting the rights of root (superadmin) you can try to get to some account in the system.

# Find Linux Kernel Version

1 method:
uname -r # Current Linux version
uname -mrs

2 method:
cat /proc/version

`lsb_release -a` # Display your current Linux distribution name and version

find the users which belong to the root group in the /etc/group file which stores group information or defines the user groups:

`cat /etc/group | grep :0:`

#find the users which belong to the sudo group ...:

`cat /etc/group | grep sudo # ft_root`

#same but with admin group:

`cat /etc/group | grep admin #ft_root`

# to reboot: reboot -f

## Login into any account

1. You need to know the name of user. 

after you have root rights you can see the system files by using commands: 

> cat /etc/group - shows all existing groups in the system
the structure of the file is `group name:password:GID:list of users`

> cat /etc/passwd - shows login, user_id, group_id, name, download directory

> cat /etc/shadow - shows 
Username : It is your login name.
Password : It is your encrypted password. The password should be minimum 8-12 characters long including special characters, digits, lower case alphabetic and more. Usually password format is set to $id$salt$hashed, The $id is the algorithm used On GNU/Linux as follows:
$1$ is MD5
$2a$ is Blowfish
$2y$ is Blowfish
$5$ is SHA-256
$6$ is SHA-512
Last password change (lastchanged) : Days since Jan 1, 1970 that password was last changed
Minimum : The minimum number of days required between password changes i.e. the number of days left before the user is allowed to change his/her password
Maximum : The maximum number of days the password is valid (after that user is forced to change his/her password)
Warn : The number of days before password is to expire that user is warned that his/her password must be changed
Inactive : The number of days after password expires that account is disabled
Expire : days since Jan 1, 1970 that account is disabled i.e. an absolute date specifying when the login may no longer be used.

2. To delete password you need to:
- choose some login;
- find him in group file and using vim delete password (the second part of the string);
- in file shadow delete all information after the second semicolon, but leave all other semicolons, also using vim.

3. After that you can use `login user_name` comand to login the system.
